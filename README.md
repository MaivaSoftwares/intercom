# Intercom

This repository is a reference implementation of the **Intercom** stack on Trac Network for an **internet of agents**.

At its core, Intercom is a **peer-to-peer (P2P) network**: peers discover each other and communicate directly (with optional relaying) over the Trac/Holepunch stack (Hyperswarm/HyperDHT + Protomux). There is no central server required for sidechannel messaging.

Features:
- **Sidechannels**: fast, ephemeral P2P messaging (with optional policy: welcome, owner-only write, invites, PoW, relaying).
- **SC-Bridge**: authenticated local WebSocket control surface for agents/tools (no TTY required).
- **Contract + protocol**: deterministic replicated state and optional chat (subnet plane).
- **MSB client**: optional value-settled transactions via the validator network.

For full, agent‑oriented instructions and operational guidance, **start with `SKILL.md`**.  
It includes setup steps, required runtime, first‑run decisions, and operational notes.

## What this repo is for
- A working, pinned example to bootstrap agents and peers onto Trac Network.
- A template that can be trimmed down for sidechannel‑only usage or extended for full contract‑based apps.

## How to use
Use the **Pear runtime only** (never native node).  
Follow the steps in `SKILL.md` to install dependencies, run the admin peer, and join peers correctly.

## Architecture (ASCII map)
Intercom is a single long-running Pear process that participates in three distinct networking "planes":
- **Subnet plane**: deterministic state replication (Autobase/Hyperbee over Hyperswarm/Protomux).
- **Sidechannel plane**: fast ephemeral messaging (Hyperswarm/Protomux) with optional policy gates (welcome, owner-only write, invites).
- **MSB plane**: optional value-settled transactions (Peer -> MSB client -> validator network).

  Optional for local testing:
  - --dht-bootstrap "<host:port,host:port>" overrides the peer's HyperDHT bootstraps
    (all peers that should discover each other must use the same list).

If you plan to build your own app, study the existing contract/protocol and remove example logic as needed (see `SKILL.md`).

## Competition App: InterSplit (P2P Expense Splitter)
InterSplit is a sidechannel-native shared expense ledger for teams, friends, and co-travelers.

What it does:
- Tracks shared expenses in any sidechannel room.
- Computes per-member balances (who owes vs who should receive).
- Produces a minimal settlement plan (debtor -> creditor payments).
- Syncs entries peer-to-peer over Intercom sidechannels (no central server).
- Persists room snapshots into contract state for recovery after restarts.
- Exports settlement plans in one shot (`text`, `json`, or `csv`).

Terminal commands:
- `/expense_add --channel "<name>" --payer "<name>" --amount "<n>" --split "a,b,c" [--note "<text>"]`
- `/expense_list --channel "<name>"`
- `/expense_balance --channel "<name>"`
- `/expense_clear --channel "<name>"`
- `/expense_persist --channel "<name>" [--sim 1]`
- `/expense_restore --channel "<name>" [--confirmed 1|0] [--replace 1]`
- `/expense_export --channel "<name>" [--format text|json|csv]`

SC-Bridge JSON commands:
- `expense_add` with `channel`, `payer`, `amount`, `split`, optional `note`
- `expense_list` with `channel`
- `expense_balance` with `channel`
- `expense_clear` with `channel`
- `expense_persist` with `channel`, optional `sim`
- `expense_restore` with `channel`, optional `confirmed`, `replace`
- `expense_export` with `channel`, optional `format`

Contract persistence keys:
- `expense/room/<channel>` stores room snapshots (`events`) and update metadata.

Quick 60-second demo:
1. Peer A and Peer B join the same sidechannel, e.g. `trip-nyc`.
2. Add two expenses:
   - `/expense_add --channel "trip-nyc" --payer "alice" --amount "30" --split "alice,bob" --note "dinner"`
   - `/expense_add --channel "trip-nyc" --payer "bob" --amount "10" --split "alice,bob" --note "snacks"`
3. View settlement:
   - `/expense_balance --channel "trip-nyc"`
4. Persist:
   - `/expense_persist --channel "trip-nyc"`
5. Export ready-to-share settlement:
   - `/expense_export --channel "trip-nyc" --format text`
